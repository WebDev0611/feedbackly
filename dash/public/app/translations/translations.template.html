<a translate>Your first step to getting know your customer better is creating a survey.
Use the survey creation tool to do it - it takes just seconds!
Here you can also find survey setups and language selection.
You can use any language you like! After the survey is done,
just follow the process and it will guide you through.</a>
<span translate>Create new feedback channels and choose the methods to collect your feedback data with the survey you just created.
There is a variety of options from tablet kiosk to email and websites.</span>
<span translate>Next you need to setup your channels to collect the data.
Depending on what type of channels you chose to use, the software will ask you to do the setup.</span>
<span translate>In the publishing settings go through the parts to get detailed instruction on the setup.
For example, you may download the app to your tablet from here.
Here you can also choose whether to publish the survey now or
schedule it to be automatically published later.</span>
<span translate>After the setup it is time to publish your surveys in the channels you like!
The last page tells you what you have planned to do so you can make your last review.
If everything is set, just hit “Publish” and wait for the data to come in.
If there is something you would like to change, just click on that part of the process bar and edit.
At this point you should already have completed setting up your channels.</span>
<span translate>After collecting your first feedbacks, an overview will be visible on the landing page.
For a detailed report head to the Results-section.
Feedbacks can filtered based on channel, survey and even based on the individual answers given!
</span>
<span translate>Now you have the basic knowledge to start learning about your customers. Just click below to start turning your happy customers into more business and better sales.</span>
