<span translate>After the setup it is time to publish your surveys in the channels you like!
The last page tells you what you have planned to do so you can make your last review.
If everything is set, just hit “Publish” and wait for the data to come in.
If there is something you would like to change, just click on that part of the process bar and edit.
At this point you should already have completed setting up your channels.</span>
