          Channel groups are exactly what they sound like -- a group containing different channels. Feedbackly's user and rights management builds around channel groups. After adding channels to a group, you can assign users with rights to different groups depending on what they need to see.
          Users who have rights to a channel group can publish surveys and see the results of those channels that are included in the group.
